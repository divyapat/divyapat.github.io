            What Is a Drought?
            <hr>
            Droughts are one of the worst natural disasters to occur.  A drought is a lengthy period of time, stretching months or even years in which time; land has a decrease in water supply.  This can happen at any given time, even in winter time, however, for most droughts, they do occur during warmer or drier months. Droughts happen when surface or underground water is reduced greatly, and in particular, when rain doesn‚Äôt occur during long periods of time, it can do considerable damage.
            <hr>
            A drought can have a massive impact on agriculture and the ecosystem also. Though, some droughts can last only a small period of time, sometimes, less than a month.  However, there are also severe droughts which can last years and can have a significant effect on the land which holds the drought.  It does a lot of damage to the local economy as well as further regions also.

            Global Drought
            <hr>
            In any part of the world, a drought can occur. This is a normal and natural disaster which can affect any country in any part of world; and this is a recurring element of climate. Of course, if the weather is balanced all throughout the year, then the likelihood of drought is very unlikely, however, not all parts of the world have a balanced weather system.
            <hr>
            Even those with unbalanced weather, the climate can handle things and not cause any droughts to suffer. However, not all parts of the globe are this lucky and do suffer badly from drought.  However, most can avoid a drought or the impact especially those who grow their own crops, by using the crop rotation method.
            <hr>
            However, if a drought recurs and continues to recur, it can in fact lead to desertification.  This can happen if a region or area of land has seen a prolonged period of drought or a reoccurrence of droughts.  When desertification occurs due to drought, it can have a huge and very much a grave ecological catastrophe such as that of the Horn of Africa.  The Horn of Africa has been the scene of recurring droughts.
            <hr>
            In some countries around the world, a drought can cause all out war. There have been many wars started because of droughts. People cannot grow crops and cannot make a living and many struggle to get to food sources to allow them to survive.  As a result the wars can break out; there has been several civil wars breaking out because of droughts.

            The Damage?
            <hr>
            The effect of a drought can have a huge impact on many areas because both wildlife and plant life can die. These can happen in the most extreme droughts; though for short droughts, most wildlife can be saved, plants are another matter. However, the land in which the plant life is growing can be badly damage and start to show a huge decline including cracking and breaking up.
            <hr>
            However, fruits and vegetables growing in the ground can stop growing and entire crops can be destroyed. There have been several droughts which have caused a lot of damage to plants and crops which have caused vegetable prices to increase in stores. This is just one of the many effects which can occur because of a drought.
            <hr>
            There are some plants and species of plants can actually survive and adapt during a drought.  Plants such as Cacti can adapt during a drought because it can reduce its leaf areas in order for it to tolerate the change in condition. Any drought, no matter the length, can have a huge impact on any agriculture.  In regions such as Africa, it has been a crisis that frequently occurs.
